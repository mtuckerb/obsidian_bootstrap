# Getting Started
This repo has two branches; `main` and `presentation`. The former is intended to jumpstart your obsidian experience and be the basis of your first vault, the latter is mostly for posterity, but it is the presentation that I gave on November 30 2022 to the Eng Team at Copia. 

# Bootstrapping
I would strongly recommend that you clone this repo and then 
```shell
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin <your own private github repo>
```
This way you can keep your notes privately synched to github using the Obsidian Git plugin.

Once you have set up the Obsidian Git plugin with your personal access token, you are ready to start using Obsidian. I would also recommend that you start by looking at the installed plugins, `cmd + ,` -> **Community Plugins** -> **Installed Plugins** configuring them as needed.

With that behind you, you should have a pretty good idea of what is going to be possible with the plugins you have installed. I refer back pretty often to my installed plugins, to remind me of things I forgot. (e.g. I rediscovered Pluck today). It's time to start taking notes.

# First Notes
## Sprint Notes
If you are starting with Sprint Notes, you'll want to use the amazing Agile Task Notes plugin. Hit `cmd + p` and type `Agile` and select the "Update Current Sprint" option. If you set up the plugin with your Atlassian credentials, and set the folder to Ephemera (defaults), you should be able to navigate to the folder named for the current sprint and see a Kanban board 

## Meeting Notes
If you are starting this journey in a meeting, hit `cmd + option + N` and you will be prompted for a meeting Title. Fill that in, hit enter and be amazed.
