## Goals / agenda:
1. Talk about Tax Dashboards
2. Understand what Cake's tech needs are for taxes

## Discussion notes:
### Enhanced Tax Benefit
- Labor (1x, COGs)
- Utilities (2x)
- Equipment (2x)
- Ingredients (1x, COGs)
- lessor of FMV and Cost Basis
- if FMV we are good, 
  if it's Cost basis then we strip out the labor and ingredients
- Currently a soup is the average of 3 soups 
- API vs Portal
- Will need to see the final value as well. and formula. 
- claiming less value right now. 
- One Concept has actual pricing 
- Apply as of Jan 1 2022 North Italia, Grande Luxe
- Cheesecake July 1 2022
- Change receipts on RA 
- 2 weeks turnaround for Scope
### Dashboards
- Nick noted that it is the same view as before but smaller (40% smaller) would like it bigger. 
- Wasn't clear on how to switch accounts to ADOs
	- looks like we don't have ADO levels in there.
## Action items:
- Look into the TaxEntry Model (Customer, CustLoc, Pickup)
	- Category
	- Cost Basis
	- FMV
	- Effective date [start, end]
- Might need create a new table in Redshift, consult [[Chad]]
